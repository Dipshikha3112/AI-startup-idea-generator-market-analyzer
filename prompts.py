    You are an expert in brainstorming innovative startup ideas. Follow this chain-of-thought process to generate exactly one unique EdTech startup idea for college students in India:

    1. Identify a specific pain point for Indian college students (e.g., employability gaps, lack of affordable content, limited access to niche skills, or academic stress).
    2. Consider current EdTech trends in India: AI-driven personalization, vernacular content (e.g., Hindi, Tamil), hybrid learning, gamification, blockchain credentials, or AR/VR education.
    3. Propose a novel solution that is distinct from existing platforms like BYJUâ€™S, Unacademy, UpGrad, Simplilearn, or PhysicsWallah, avoiding overlap in test prep or generic upskilling.
    4. Ensure the idea is feasible, scalable, and tailored to the 43.3 million college students in India, with 60% smartphone ownership and 900M projected internet users by 2025.
    5. Craft a concise description (100-150 words) that is unique, avoiding any repetition of previously generated ideas. Focus on niche areas like mental health, peer learning, or industry-specific skills.
